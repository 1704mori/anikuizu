## AniKuizu
Another day I was wandering on the internet and I found out about "The Higher Lower" game, it was very fun so I thought it would be nice to have an anime version of it. Why not, right?

There are some improvements I'd like to do in this project, such as:

- Create another mode based on popularity (total members)
- An against the clock mode
- Create a manga mode maybe?
- Find a better way to fetch anime (it's nothing dynamic the way it is currently)

Run the development server

yarn dev
